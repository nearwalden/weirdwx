# Notes on transition to V3

## Forecast call

### Creating the call

Status:  now working

- change URL to v3
- move API key to query arg
- move location to query arg
- added unis and lang

### Dealing with data

tripped up by top-level data being array in forecast call

## Days call

Link off of Historical Weather page is broken

Might want to think about re-orging pages, since makes it look like there's no Pro features until you read carefully

No "Location and Time Parameters" document (link at bottom of page)

Why can't I pass in a complete ISO date?  Also, query arg is named 'time' when it is really a date.

Are the multiple loc or time queries a different endpoint, or everything really the same?  Seems to make it hard to check for pro account.

## Questions and observations

- most things are spelled out, but not the word 'key' or 'location' in the query.  Understand about loc since it may be repeated, but 'k' v. 'key'?

- excludes not working.  Do they not exist any more?  Aren't they important?

- can we put in a URL for licenses and put them on the web?

- comments and licenses are 383 characters.  at 2.5B calls/month and 1B per character, this is 1TB of BW per month.

- total length is 56KB for a forecast call.  For what I wanted, previous was 
566B (100x difference).  with no Excludes (default) the length in v2 is 29KB

- 'verbosity' not documented
